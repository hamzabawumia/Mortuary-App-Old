FEATURE : Showing a modal for the lab results

So based on some complaints i have changed the link to show the labs in a modal

The whole modal code is in the smcproject/templates/admin/modal_bootstrap3.html

This modal html page is then included in the smcproject/templates/admin/base.html

Now the "Lab / Other investigations" Link uses the following code to target and call the modal, when clicked

<span style="float:right;">
                        <button 
                        class="btn btn-warning" 
                        style="color:white" 
                        role="button"
                        data-toggle="modal" 
                        data-target="#modal-fullscreen" > Lab / Other Investigation Results  </button>
<hr>

</span>

the modal contains the iframe with an src to the link that opens the desired page.
