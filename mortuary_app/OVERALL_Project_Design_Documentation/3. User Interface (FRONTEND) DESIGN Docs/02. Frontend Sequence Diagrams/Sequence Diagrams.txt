UI or Client Side Sequence diagrams are very useful as they help you to Visualize your UI function calls from start to finish. E.G. the javascript functions that a called here and there on each event.

You can do sequence diagrams for each use case.  But we mainly focus on the UI events and javascript function calls

NOTE THAT Sequence diagrams becomes very handy when you have many javascript function calls in your UI. Apart from that, I normally don’t use them much.
