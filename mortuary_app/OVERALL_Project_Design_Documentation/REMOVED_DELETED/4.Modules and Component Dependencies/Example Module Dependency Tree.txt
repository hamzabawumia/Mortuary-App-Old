REMEMBER;  a module is simply a code snippet that is imported and used in another file

It is simply a diagram or a chart 
that shows how your code modules import other modules (along with the file paths.)

This becomes very important especially when you are importing and using several modules all over the place.
SO IN YOUR APPS - YOU CAN SIMPLY ADD A FILE called module_dependency_tree and list them as shown below


THE BEST way to show your module chart is to use a module tree like so:
// Moving from the outermost module and stepping down to the inner_most module.

OUTERMOST_MODULE { imports 
                        MIDDLE_MODULE from "file_location",
                        xyz_module from "full_file_path"
                }

                MIDDLE_MODULE  { imports 
                                        efg_MODULE from "file_location",
                                        adc_module from "full_file_path" 
                            } 
                            INNER_MODULE  { imports 
                                        efg_MODULE from "file_location",
                                        adc_module from "full_file_path" 
                            }
            
            
            
Another syntax:

layouts/ # file_path: public/custom_script_files/vue_code.js
  partials/
    |-- footer/
        |-- scripts.html
        |-- site-footer.html
    |-- header/
        |-- header.html
        |-- site.html
