REMEMBER;  a module is simply a code snippet that is imported and used in another file

It is simply a diagram or a chart 
that shows how your code modules import other modules 
(and it even shows the location of the module files themselves.)

This is becomes very important especially when you are importing and using several modules all over the place.
SO IN YOUR APPS - YOU CAN SIMPLY ADD A FILE called module_flow_chart and list them as shown below


THE BEST way to show your module chart is to use a module tree like so:
// Moving from the outermost module and stepping down to the inner_most module.

OUTERMOST_MODULE (this imports MIDDLE_MODULE from "file_location")
    MIDDLE_MODULE  (this imports INNER_MODULE from "file_location")
        INNER_MODULE
